# main2

A framework for building CLI apps in Node.js, and the successor to `cli-kit`.
The heart of it is a multi-pass hierarchical argument parser built for CLIs
that lean heavily on subcommands.

**Zero production dependencies is a hard constraint.** Anything the library
needs — ANSI handling, text wrapping, dotenv, `which`, debug logging — gets
written here and bundled. Do not add a runtime dependency; if one seems
necessary, raise it rather than adding it.

## Layout

| Path                     | Contents                                             |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |

| `src/help/`              | The generated help screen and its two-column layout  |
| `src/util/`              | Shared helpers (type coercion, camelCase, mkdir)     |
| `src/debug/`             | `DEBUG`-driven logger; replaces snooplogg            |

| `test/parser/commander/` | Ported Commander test cases                          |
| `test/parser/yargs/`     | Ported yargs-parser test cases                       |

`src/canvas/`, `src/components/`, and `src/i18n/` are empty placeholders. Canvas
and components are post-1.0.

`src/width/east-asian-width.ts` is generated. Regenerate it with
`node scripts/generate-east-asian-width.mjs <unicode-version>` and then
`pnpm fmt`; the version is pinned in the script so re-running reproduces what is
committed.

## Commands

```
pnpm test          # vitest
pnpm check         # type-check + lint + format check
pnpm build         # tsdown -> dist/
pnpm fmt           # oxfmt --write
```

Run `pnpm check` before considering work finished. Formatting is oxfmt with
tabs, single quotes, and a 100-column width — run `pnpm fmt` rather than
matching it by hand.

## Scope

1.0 is the parser, a generated help screen, ANSI wrapping, and ANSI strip.
Nothing else. Titanium CLI is the acceptance test: if it does not need a
feature, that feature is not in 1.0.

All four are in. What is left for 1.0 is static argv types, the Titanium port,
and whatever that port turns up.

## Deliberate decisions — do not "fix" these

These look like bugs and are not. Each is intentional and covered by tests.

- **`<value>` in an option format makes the option itself required**, not just
  its value. This diverges from Commander and yargs. Use `[value]` for an
  optional option that takes a value. Asserted in
  `test/parser/options.test.ts`.
- **The default data type is `string`, not `auto`.** `auto` guesses lossily —
  it turns `007` into `7` — and makes static types unusable. It is still
  available per option.
- **Commands resolve against the innermost context; options resolve across the
  whole context chain.** These are deliberately different. Making them the
  same breaks either parent options after a subcommand, or arguments that
  repeat a command name. Both directions are covered in
  `test/parser/regressions.test.ts`.
- **An option consumes the next token unless that token resolves to a declared
  option.** `--name --verbose` leaves `--verbose` alone; `--name --undeclared`
  takes `--undeclared` as the value. Commander errors on any dash-leading
  value, but values legitimately start with a dash and a schema only knows its
  own options. See `test/parser/option-values.test.ts` and `docs/parser.md`.
- **An option takes one value per use; only arguments are variadic.**
  `multiple` collects repeated uses (`--tag a --tag b`) into an array. An
  option never eats consecutive values, so `--tag a b` leaves `b` positional;
  `<files...>` on an _argument_ is how a list of loose values is collected. A
  `...` hint on an option is therefore rejected by `initOption` rather than
  accepted as decoration. Both Commander and yargs diverge here.
- **A required option rejects a missing or empty value; an optional one gets
  an empty string.** `--name` and `--name=` throw for `<value>` and yield `''`
  (or `0`, per the data type) for `[value]`.
- **`bool` is strict and symmetric.** `true`/`t`/`yes`/`y`/`on`/`1` are
  true, `false`/`f`/`no`/`n`/`off`/`0`/`''` are false, case-insensitively,
  and anything else throws. It does not follow minimist's
  "anything but `'false'`" rule, which made `--flag=0` true, nor
  yargs-parser's "only `'true'`", which makes `--flag=1` false. Every other
  data type already rejects input it cannot parse, and `0`/`1` is the usual
  convention for boolean environment variables.
- **Flags default to `false`, or `true` when negated — never `undefined`.**
  Commander leaves an unspecified flag undefined. A declared flag here always
  has a value, so `argv.verbose` is safe to read without a guard.
- **A bare positional name is optional; `<name>` is required.** Commander
  treats a bare name as required. Brackets are the only thing that decides it
  here, which keeps `args` readable at a glance.
- **String `default`s and environment values are coerced to the declared
  type.** So `default: 'yes'` on a flag is `true`, not `'yes'`, and a value
  the type rejects throws — `default: 'black'` on a flag is an error, the
  same way a default of `'nope'` on an `int` is. Non-string defaults pass
  through untouched.
- **The option format string is loose on purpose.** Extra short or long names
  become aliases rather than errors, and a bare word declares `--word`.
  Commander rejects all of those. Genuinely malformed parts — `-ws`,
  `---triple` — still throw.
- **An option and its negated twin share a destination, and the valued one
  owns it.** `'--cheese <type>'` plus `'--no-cheese'` is one destination set
  by two options, as in Commander. Unlike Commander it is order-independent,
  which costs the negated flag its implied `true`: the valued twin decides the
  default, so the pair is `undefined` until something sets it rather than
  silently `true`. A `default` declared on the flag is still honored, and
  `negate: false` opts out of the pairing. See `test/parser/options.test.ts`.
- **`main2()` handles errors instead of rejecting.** A thrown value from
  `parse()` or from the command's `run()` is rendered by `errorHandler()` —
  the message, never a stack — `process.exitCode` is set, and `main2()`
  resolves with `undefined`. Its caller is a bin script, so an unhandled
  rejection dumping a stack is the wrong default. `settings.errorHandler:
false` rethrows instead; a function replaces the handler.
- **A `beforeError` hook may replace the error but never suppress it.**
  Returning nothing leaves the error alone, returning a value makes that value
  the error, and a hook that throws is logged and skipped. Suppression would
  have to mean something different at every throw site — what `parse()`
  returns, whether the command still runs — and a rule that cannot hold
  everywhere is worse than no rule. Hooks fire for every throw site, inside
  `parse()` for what `parse()` throws and inside `main2()` for everything
  else, innermost command first and the schema last, before rendering and
  before the `errorHandler: false` opt-out. See `test/parser/hooks.test.ts`.
- **A `default` command is dispatched whenever argv named no command, even
  when it declares required arguments.** `default` means the name is implied,
  not that the command is a fallback that steps aside when the arguments are
  inconvenient — so `mycli` with a default `build <entry>` reports
  `Missing required arguments: <entry>` rather than silently doing nothing.
  Only applying it when there are no positionals would also make
  `mycli out.js` an `Unexpected argument`, which is the case a default command
  exists for. Two siblings both marked `default` throw while the schema is
  built; picking one would pick it by registration order. See
  `test/parser/default-command.test.ts`.
- **Undeclared options produce values rather than erroring.** `--foo` is
  `foo: true`, `--foo bar` is `foo: 'bar'`. They resolve after every command
  has been matched, coerce with `auto`, do not read `no-` as negation, and do
  not reach `state._`. `settings.allowUnknownOptions: false` restores the
  `Unknown option` error.
- **The first bare label in a command name is the name; the rest are
  aliases.** `'build, b'` and `'build b'` declare `build` aliased `b`. A `@` or
  `!` prefixed label is always an alias and names the command only when there
  is no bare label, so `'@ls, list'` is named `list` while `'@b'` alone is
  named `b`. Covered by `test/parser/regressions.test.ts`.
- **A `!` name prefix and an explicit `hidden` are additive.** Either one
  hides a command; an explicit `hidden: false` does not un-hide a `!` prefixed
  name — drop the `!` instead. That holds for a lazily loaded command too: the
  placeholder carries the `!`, the module never sees it. A command that
  declares neither always reads back `hidden: false`, never `undefined`, and a
  non-boolean `hidden` throws. `!` on any label hides the whole command, not
  just that one alias; an alias that should stay out of help without hiding
  the command belongs in the `alias` property, which never reaches the help
  label. Covered by `test/parser/regressions.test.ts`.

- **A command is fixed once it is initialized, and its declaration containers
  are read-only.** `cmd.args`, `cmd.commands`, and `cmd.options` echo the
  declaration; the parser reads the normalized arguments and the registries at
  `cmd[Internal]`, which are a different shape on purpose. Assigning,
  deleting, or adding to one of those three throws rather than silently
  failing to reconfigure a built command. A hook changes a command through the
  registries it is handed — `options.add()`, `args.push(initArg(...))`,
  `commands.add(await initCommand(...))` — which take effect immediately. The
  Proxy `set` traps that used to stand in for this could never have worked:
  building a command or an option is async and a `set` trap is not. The same
  line is drawn on options and arguments: `choices`, `default`, `multiple`,
  `required`, `transform`, and `type` are read on every parse and are editable
  in place, while `alias`, `env`, `format`, `name`, and `negate` built the
  registry lookups and the destination, so they are read-only too. Covered by
  `test/parser/schema.test.ts`.

### Help

- **`--help` and a `help` command are added to the root, and only where the app
  left room.** Options resolve across the whole context chain, so one `--help`
  on the root answers everywhere. Nothing is added over the top of a
  declaration: an app whose `-h` means `--host` keeps it and gets `--help`
  without the short form, and an app that declares `--help` itself gets neither
  the flag nor the short-circuit, because it owns what `--help` means.
  `schema.help: false` adds nothing at all. See `test/help/wiring.test.ts`.
- **The help flag's value never reaches `argv`.** A flag always has a value, so
  an added `--help` would put `help: false` on every app's parsed values. The
  option is marked `parserOwned` and is skipped by both fallback passes and by
  the write in `processArgs()`. An app that declares `--help` itself owns the
  value, and that one does reach `argv`.
- **Help wins over a missing required option or argument, and nothing else.**
  `parse()` detects the request after walking argv and before validating, so
  `mycli build --help` answers what `build` needs instead of complaining that it
  was not given. An _invalid_ value still throws: it failed on the way in, while
  argv was being read, and there was never a question to answer.
- **`--help` with no command named describes the program, not the default
  command.** A default command is in the context chain without argv having named
  it, and answering with its screen would hide every other command there is. The
  chain is trimmed to the commands argv actually named -- one `ParsedCommand`
  each, none for a default.
- **Help sorts commands and does not sort options.** Options are registered in
  the order the schema wrote them. Commands are registered as their
  initialization resolves, and one with subcommands of its own resolves after
  its siblings, so the registry's order is not the schema's and sorting is the
  only stable thing to print.
- **A lazily loaded command appears in help by name alone** until its module is
  read, because its description and its `hidden` are in that module. Hiding one
  is what the `!` name prefix is for. `help <command>` does load the module,
  since it is describing that one command.

## Known bugs

- A subcommand's option used before its subcommand is not protected from being
  consumed as an earlier option's value, because it is not declared yet on the
  pass that reads it. A default command's options are always in that position,
  since it joins the chain only after argv has been walked. See the warning in
  `docs/parser.md` and the pinned tests in
  `test/parser/default-command.test.ts`.

## Conventions

- ESM only. Imports use `.js` extensions even for `.ts` sources.
- Internal state hangs off the exported `Internal` symbol, not enumerable
  properties, so schema objects stay clean for consumers. `parse()` stashes the
  state it died with on the error it throws the same way, under `ErrorState`,
  so the error path can still reach the matched command.
- **`init*()` copies, never decorates.** The caller's schema, commands, args,
  and options are read-only inputs: every normalized value and the `Internal`
  symbol land on a new object the library owns. So the same schema object
  parses identically any number of times, a frozen schema parses, and a lazily
  loaded command module — which the ESM loader shares with every other
  importer — is merged into a copy rather than written to. Asserted in
  `test/parser/schema.test.ts`.
- **No Proxies.** Internal commands, arguments, and options are plain objects.
  Anything that has to stay in sync is built once by `init*()`; anything a
  consumer may change afterwards is a property nothing is derived from.
- Parser errors are thrown as plain `Error`s with user-facing messages; they
  are what the user sees, so write them accordingly.
- Prefer a regression test named after the defect over a comment explaining it.
